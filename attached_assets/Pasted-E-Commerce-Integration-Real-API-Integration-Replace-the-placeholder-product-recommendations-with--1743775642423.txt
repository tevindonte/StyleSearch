User Feedback Loop & Data Storage
Feedback Collection:
Refine your “Was this accurate?” and comment system to capture detailed user feedback on predictions and outfit suggestions.

Database Integration:
Set up a database MongoDB) to store user feedback and usage patterns.

Iterative Improvement:
Use this data to re-train or fine-tune your models periodically.

As for storing user
Connect to Verbalit
Copy your connection string below.

Select database user

Connection string
jmcanboy (SCRAM)
mongodb+srv://jmcanboy:<db_password>@verbalit.pkqcqm6.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Verbalit

Replace <db_password> with the password for the jmcanboy user. Ensure any option params are URL encoded.

Success! Your new application key has been created. It will only appear here once.
Cloud Storage for Images:
Use a solution like Backblaze B2 for efficient, scalable storage. Save images with unique identifiers, and reference these identifiers in your database.

Database for Metadata:
Store user feedback, predicted labels, and the image’s unique ID in a database. This way, you can correlate feedback with the actual images without needing to query the image files directly.

Iterative Model Improvement:
Periodically, you can pull images (and their associated data) that received negative feedback or were misclassified. This curated set can be used to re-train or fine-tune your model.

Hybrid Style Classification Enhancements
Model Fine-Tuning:
Even though your current model works, consider unfreezing parts of the backbone networks (ResNet/CLIP) or training longer to boost accuracy.
Multimodal Fusion Optimization:
Experiment with alternative fusion strategies or adjust the weight given to metadata versus visual features, especially as you refine the metadata further.

Outfit Combination Generator
Context-Aware Recommendations:
Develop logic (or a model) that assembles full outfits rather than single items—taking into account user context (e.g., occasion, season) and the individual pieces’ compatibility.
Component Breakdown:
Enhance the system so that if a user uploads an image of one item, it suggests complementary pieces to complete the look.

Frontend & UX Improvements
Enhanced User Interface:
Improve the look and feel of your app’s frontend (using frameworks like React or Bootstrap) to display not only predictions but also outfit combinations and product recommendations.
Interactive Features:
Add elements like real-time previews, detailed style breakdowns, and the ability to modify or customize recommendations.
