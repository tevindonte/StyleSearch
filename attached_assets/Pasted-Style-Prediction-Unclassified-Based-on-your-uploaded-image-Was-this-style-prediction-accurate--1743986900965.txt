we dont want to return a bunch of words and waste token stuff which is money(we are trying to save knowing that useers are going to be generating alot of outfits before seeing our first dollar , we are using this information to create an outfit meaning, instead of words youre going to ebay picking all the right things for an outfit and returning them to userm like cluster of items for the fit(shirt etc depending on what image asked for) and more clusters of images. Less words more of what things look like

in addition ebay isnt showing anything
